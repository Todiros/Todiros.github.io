					<p class="desc-title">Visual Appearance & Origin</p>
					<p class="desc-text first">The raccoon is a medium-sized mammal native to North America. The raccoon is the largest of the procyonid family, having a body length of 40 to 70 cm and a body weight of 5 to 26 kg. Two of the raccoon's most distinctive features are its extremely dexterous front paws and its facial mask.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="desc-wrap">
					<p class="desc-title">Sense</p>
					<p class="desc-text">The most important sense for the raccoon is its sense of touch. The "hyper sensitive" front paws are protected by a thin horny layer that becomes pliable when wet. The five digits of the paws have no webbing between them, which is unusual for a carnivore. Almost two-thirds of the area responsible for sensory perception in the raccoon's cerebral cortex is specialized for the interpretation of tactile impulses, more than in any other studied animal.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="desc-wrap">
					<p class="desc-title">Intelligence</p>
					<p class="desc-text">Zoologist Clinton Hart Merriam described raccoons as "clever beasts", and that "in certain directions their cunning surpasses that of the fox." The animal's intelligence gave rise to the epithet "sly coon". Only a few studies have been undertaken to determine the mental abilities of raccoons, most of them based on the animal's sense of touch. In a study by the ethologist H. B. Davis in 1908, raccoons were able to open 11 of 13 complex locks in fewer than 10 tries and had no problems repeating the action when the locks were rearranged or turned upside down. Davis concluded they understood the abstract principles of the locking mechanisms and their learning speed was equivalent to that of rhesus macaques.</p>

				<div class="desc-wrap">
					<p class="desc-title">Diet</p>
					<p class="desc-text">Though usually nocturnal, the raccoon is sometimes active in daylight to take advantage of available food sources. Its diet consists of about 40% invertebrates, 33% plant material and 27% vertebrates. Since its diet consists of such a variety of different foods, Samuel I. Zeveloff, professor of zoology at Weber State University and author of the book Raccoons: A Natural History, argues the raccoon "may well be one of the world's most omnivorous animals".</p>
				</div>
				<div class="desc-wrap">
					<p class="desc-title">Sounds</p>
					<p class="desc-text">Raccoons have a large array of vocalizations. In fact, studies have determined that these animals can make over 51 different sounds that communicate different things! They hiss, purr and growl when competing for food. Younger raccoons often chirp and squeal and often exhibit extremely high-pitched squeals.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="desc-wrap">
					<p class="desc-title">Urbanization</p>
					<p class="desc-text">Although they originated from earthly and natural habitats, raccoons love the city life! In fact, Toronto is one of the most raccoon populated cities in the world approximately fifty times more raccoons live there than in neighboring suburban areas. Consequently, not only do crowded cities provide them with lots of space to scavenge around, but they also provide raccoons with easily accessible food resources.</p>
